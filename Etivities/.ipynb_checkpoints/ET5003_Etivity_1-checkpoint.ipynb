    "## Introduction\n",
    "Real-world datasets for ML are expected to be *incomplete*, *inconsistent*, and *noisy* due to their heterogeneous origin. Applying ML algorithms on such data would not give quality results as they would fail to identify patterns effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preprocessing** is a part of the ML process, which strives to improve the overall data quality by dealing with:\n",
    "* duplicate or missing values - such data may give an incorrect view of the overall statistics of data;\n",
    "* outliers and inconsistent data points - such data often tend to disturb the modelâ€™s overall learning and thus, leading to false predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preprocessing targets ML features, which are:\n",
    "* individual independent variables operating as inputs to ML models;\n",
    "* representations or attributes that describe the data and help the models to predict the classes/labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: features in a structured dataset (e.g., in a CSV format) refer to each column representing a measurable piece of data that can be used for analysis: name, age, sex, fare, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Training** is a primary step in ML in which a ML algorithm is fed with sufficient training data to learn from. Model Training results in a working ML model that can then be validated, tested and deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "In this e-tivity, you are asked to follow the ML process to:\n",
    "* preprocess a provided dataset, so it will become suitable for ML operations;\n",
    "* select an appropriate ML model, so it will cope with the specifics of data and ML tasks;\n",
    "* train the selected ML model on the preprocessed dataset;\n",
    "* test the selected ML model on the preprocessed dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please, consult the lectures of Weeks #1 and #2 for the specifics of the different ML models, the Data Preprocessing staeps and the specifics of Model Training and Testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dataset\n",
    "The provided dataset covers bond trading operations (buy and sell) on a financial market. The data is labeled and provided in its raw format, so it needs to be preprocessed.   "
